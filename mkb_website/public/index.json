[{"categories":null,"contents":"Teaching Experience Science communication, education, and outreach are incredibly important to me. Because of this, I have volunteered and taught through numerous Cornell-affiliated organizations during the course of my PhD. These include:\nSkills for Public Engagement (PLSCI 3940 - Cornell undergraduate/graduate class, guest speaker presenting the seed dispersal game) Expanding Your Horizons The Graduate Student School Outreach Program (GRASSHOPR) Freeville Elementary School Research and Education Activities for Community Teachers (REACT) Teaching Assistant for Plant Genetics (PLBRG 2250) Developed Course Materials I developed an activity called \u0026ldquo;Cabbages and their cousins: the dogs of the plant world\u0026rdquo; where students identify shared morphology between modern cabbages and their wild, undomesticated Brassica ancestor. The students then create a \u0026ldquo;super cabbage\u0026rdquo; with all of the domesticated products glued onto a wild Brassica plant. Teach this activity yourself using the materials available on my GitHub page!\nIn collaboration with Aimee Schulz, we refined a outreach event called, \u0026ldquo;Plant Domestication and Adaptation: A Seed Dispersal Game\u0026rdquo; that Aimee developed as part of the ASPB Conviron Scholars program. We have presented this game to numerous grade levels, class sizes, and formats (in person, online). This activity has students build \u0026ldquo;seeds\u0026rdquo; (note cards) optimized for wind-based dispersal in the wild. In the second round, students domesticate their seeds to be optimized for their ease of harvest within farmer fields. Our teaching materials are available on the Buckler Lab website and Bitbucket repository. To expand the adoption of this game, we presented a poster at the 2023 Maize Genetics Conference. Our poster and zines are available on Bitbucket! A video of us implementing this game virtually is below.\nTeaching Experience in More Detail These are all of the outreach/teaching events I have participated in:\n2022 - Taught two workshops as part of the Research and Education Activities for Community Teachers (REACT) program to 25-30 elementary to high school teachers from across New York State titled: “Cabbages and their cousins: the dogs of the plant world” and “Plant domestication and adaptation, a seed dispersal game.” 2022 - Taught one in-person workshop on Plant Domestication and Adaptation to the thrid grade class at Freeville Elementary School. 2022 – Taught four in-person classes as part of the GRASSHOPR program to 15 students at the Southern Cayuga Junior/High school. The four classes were named “a-MAIZE-ing diversity: How plant breeders make your favorite foods even better.” Taught students about natural versus artificial selection with various hands-on activities ranging from DNA extraction using strawberries, generating, and testing hypotheses on what grains ‘pop’, creating and domesticating wild seeds, and identifying shared plant morphology between wild and domesticated plants. 2022 - Taught three in-person workshops at the one day Expanding Your Horizons conference titled ‘Plant Domestication and Adaptation: A Seed Dispersal Game” to 40 middle school students and parents. 2021 - Graduate Teaching Assistant for Plant Genetics. The assistantship entailed teaching two lab sections to a total of 20 students, creating lab materials (quizzes, lab lectures, slides, pre-lab videos), grading exams, and running various experiments with students. 2021 - Taught two virtual workshops at Expanding Your Horizons titled ‘Plant Domestication and Adaptation: A Seed Dispersal Game” at appropriate NY State Science Standards levels for elementary and middle school students.

With QTL mapping we found 2 significant QTL that explained 16% and 17% of the phenotypic variation. Markers could be developed to introgress these loci into breeding programs. Abstract Pollen cross-contamination has been a major problem for maize breeders. Mechanical methods applied to avoid cross-contamination are largely ineffective and time-consuming. Cross incompatibility barriers are genetic factors involved in maize fertilization that can be used as an effective method to prevent pollen cross-contamination. Teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1) is a cross-incompatibility system in which silks possessing dominant Tcb1-s reject pollen possessing the recessive allele (tcb1). However, successful fertilization occurs when Tcb1-s pollen falls upon tcb1 silks or under self-fertilization of Tcb1-s pollen on Tcb1-s silks. Previous studies have shown that the efficacy of dominant Tcb1-s was reduced when repeatedly backcrossing with maize inbred lines suggesting the presence of modifiers to Tcb1-s. To find those modifiers, we conducted a QTL mapping experiment using the Intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for two consecutive years. Two significant and stable QTL were identified on chromosomes 4L and 5S explained 16% and 17.6% of the total phenotypic variation (R2), and both had negative additive effects. Further investigation of these QTL regions identified twelve candidate genes that could modify Tcb1-s activity. The introgression of the Tcb1-s genetic system, and its appropriate modifying factors, could be a novel and reliable solution for cultivar isolation in maize breeding.\nThis paper is available on bioRxiv ( https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.18.500501) ","permalink":"https://merkhaiburch.github.io/publications/tcb1/","tags":null,"title":"Genomic mapping of the modifiers of teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Short Summary: The start of genomic prediction began with Meuwissen, Hayes, \u0026amp; Goddard 2011. Standard genomic selection models may benefit from additional information along the central dogma, or outside of it (i.e., expression, metabolites, microbiome). Incorporating crop growth models with genomic prediction may further enchance prediction models. Abstract Maize (Zea mays L.) has been a focus of scientific research and breeding for over a century. It is also one of the most economically important crops in the world, with a value of approximately US$50 billion per year in the United States alone. Additionally, maize has long been the model species of choice for the study and exploitation of hybrid vigor, and it continues to be one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most efficient converters of photosynthetic energy into starch. This review discusses the history and future of maize predictive breeding in the context of both genotype centric methods, and those focusing on genotype × environment × management interactions. Current prediction challenges are highlighted, as well as important advances in technology, methods, datasets, interdisciplinary collaborations, and scientific culture that will enable accelerated progress in predictive maize (and other crop species) breeding for years to come.\nThis paper is published in Crop Science (https://doi.org/10.1002/csc2.20052) ","permalink":"https://merkhaiburch.github.io/publications/predictive_breeding/","tags":null,"title":"Predictive breeding for maize: Making use of molecular phenotypes, machine learning, and physiological crop models"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Project Status: Ongoing Short Summary We developed an inbred and hybrid population from the maize NAM founders and collected RNAseq data from four different tissues. We developed a RNAseq quantification pipeline optimized towards highly repetitive, complex genomes. I am currently building models to quantify the scale of TE effects towards gene expression. Abstract Transposable elements (TEs) contribute to ~85% of the maize genome and have been shown to impact genome structure and gene regulation by rearranging, adding, disrupting, or silencing endogenous promoters. In maize, large-effect TE insertions have implications on phenotypes, such as flowering time and the shift to apical dominance. The effect that TEs have on the expression of non-domestication genes during normal plant development is less understood and typically confounded by trans-regulatory sequences, which are unlinked from the focal gene and act through diffusible products. Because cis-regulatory sequences are linked to the gene they impact, we partition the variance in gene expression into the highly heritable cis-only component, allele-specific expression, and measured expression to determine which TEs cause substantial effects on gene expression. Using RNAseq data generated in inbred and hybrid genotypes created from the founders of the maize Nested Association Mapping panel, we found that less than 1% of all cis-regulatory transposable element insertions regulate or disrupt gene expression in non-stressed tissues. We then characterized the types of genes impacted through gene ontology enrichment and described other genomic features associated with these expression changes. These patterns can guide plant breeders on how to design high-yielding maize varieties more suited to new environments and conditions.\nFunding This project is funded by a USDA NIFA AFRI Predoctoral Fellowship: Regulatory adaptation of transposable elements and their effect on gene expression in maize and the Andropogoneae.\nCode Availibility Code for this project will become available on Bitbucket upon publication.\nPublication This paper is in preparation.\n","permalink":"https://merkhaiburch.github.io/projects/creations/te_expression/","tags":null,"title":"Limited contribution of transposable elements to regulatory adaptation in maize inbreds and hybrids"},{"categories":["R"],"contents":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","permalink":"https://merkhaiburch.github.io/blog/force-ssl/","tags":["apache","apache","redirect","rewrite","ssl","web development"],"title":"Forcing Visits to use SSL"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Project Status: Complete Short Summary: Pleiotropy is not common in maize Pleiotropy in crop plants is highly constrained by evolution Pleiotropy results may vary by population and trait type Abstract Pleiotropy - when a single gene controls two or more seemingly unrelated traits - has been shown to impact genes with effects on flowering time, leaf architecture, and inflorescence morphology in maize.
