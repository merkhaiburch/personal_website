      <title>Elucidating the patterns of pleiotropy and its biological relevance in maize</title>

      <description>Short Summary: Pleiotropy is not common in maize Pleiotropy in crop plants is highly constrained by evolution Pleiotropy results may vary by population and trait type Abstract Pleiotropy - when a single gene controls two or more seemingly unrelated traits - has been shown to impact genes with effects on flowering time, leaf architecture, and inflorescence morphology in maize. However, the genome-wide impact of true biological pleiotropy across all maize phenotypes is largely unknown.</description>

      <title>The perils and promise of single-gene solutions to crop yield: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</title>

      <description>Short Summary: Increasing crop yield is critical for global populations, yet many crop molecular biology studies are touted as yield breakthroughs without sufficient replication to evaluate field performance, slowing progress within plant breeding. Here we suggest guidelines for the community to rigorously test the effect of genes on crop yield. Abstract Agriculture relies on plant breeding and genetics to deliver the best crop varieties and agronomic practices that will deploy results across nearly a billion hectares of cropland.</description>

      <title>Genomic mapping of the modifiers of teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1)</title>
      <link>https://merkhaiburch.github.io/publications/tcb1/</link>

      <description>Short Summary: Tcb1 is one of roughly 10 cross-incompatibility systems in maize. With QTL mapping we found 2 significant QTL that explained 16% and 17% of the phenotypic variation. Markers could be developed to introgress these loci into breeding programs. Abstract Pollen cross-contamination has been a major problem for maize breeders. Mechanical methods applied to avoid cross-contamination are largely ineffective and time-consuming. Cross incompatibility barriers are genetic factors involved in maize fertilization that can be used as an effective method to prevent pollen cross-contamination.</description>

      <title>Predictive breeding for maize: Making use of molecular phenotypes, machine learning, and physiological crop models</title>

      <description>Short Summary: The start of genomic prediction began with Meuwissen, Hayes, &amp;amp; Goddard 2011. Standard genomic selection models may benefit from additional information along the central dogma, or outside of it (i.e., expression, metabolites, microbiome). Incorporating crop growth models with genomic prediction may further enchance prediction models. Abstract Maize (Zea mays L.) has been a focus of scientific research and breeding for over a century. It is also one of the most economically important crops in the world, with a value of approximately US$50 billion per year in the United States alone.</description>
