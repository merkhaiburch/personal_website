Zines are small circulation publications that typically include original or appropriated images and texts. I started creating zines for my scientific projects to hand out at conferences as mementos. My zines typically include an overview of my project, brief results, key takeaways, contact information, and my resume on the inner page. I hand out anywhere from 20-60 zines per conference, depending on my poster's location and the size of the conference. 

I have also created zines for many outreach events to give out once the activity is over to help remind students & attendees what the key takeways from the activity were.

### Currently available zines include:
- Cabbages and their cousins: the dogs of the plant world. 
- Plant domestication and adaptation: a seed dispersal game.
- Elucidating the patterns of pleiotropy and its biological relevance in maize.
- Jumping into gene regulation: understanding the regulatory adaptation of transposable elements and their effect on gene expression in maize.
