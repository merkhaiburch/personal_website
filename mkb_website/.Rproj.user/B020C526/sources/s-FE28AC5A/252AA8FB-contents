I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Ed Buckler's lab in the Section of Plant Breeding and Genetics at Cornell University. My research investigates the extent to which pleiotropy controls phenotypes within the maize genome and the role of transposable elements in regulating gene expression. I have a passion for designing and implementing models to understand the genetic basis and regulation of complex quantitative traits. In my free time I enjoy hiking, baking, and creating beadwork.
